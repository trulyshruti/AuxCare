    "details" : "Certain diseases (like Parkinson's Disease) often limit patients from engaging in their normal life activities, engaging with other people, etc. Patients often leave their homes less during the day. mPower seeks to objectively quantify how much its users travel outside of their homes, and relate this to some of the other data provided in the study. The application will only record the total number of miles away from your home travelled each day - we will not, under any circumstances, keep track of where or when you travelled. Knowing the location of your home helps us measure this distance, which is a measure of socialization - an important metric to better understand the disease. The location of your home allows us to understand the radius of movement of a user - something that could not be measured by solely tracking distance travelled.\n\nIt is important to note that your home location will ONLY be recorded on your phone and will not be shared with our investigators or anyone else. We respect your privacy and understand the sensitivity of this and all other information collected by the study - your privacy and securing your data is paramount to this study and to each of the persons involved in it.\n\nThank you for providing access to this information - and for helping us better understand this disease.",
